FOR ex2 WE INCLUDED A FILE NAMED "Flow charts ex2" THAT CONTAINS FLOW CHART IMAGES OF ALL THE METHODS IN ORDER FOR US TO
LOOK THROUGH AND GUARANTEE THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED BRANCH COVERAGE. BRANCH COVERAGE GUARANTEES IN TURN THAT WE HAVE
ACHIEVED STATEMENT COVERAGE SINCE IT'S A STRONGER FORM OF TESTING.

The method: insert(int x):

* The specification:
    - requires: x is an integer
    - ensures: if x is not in the set
               then
                    if x is the smallest
                    then
                        add x at index 0 and shift all other elements one step to the right
                    else if x is the biggest
                    then
                        add x at index (set.size())
                    otherwise
                        add x at the correctly ordered position so that the set is in ascending order and shift all
                        other elements that are larger than x one step to the right
               otherwise
                    return and the set is unchanged

Input space:
    x in {MIN_INT, ..., 0, ..., MAX_INT}

    Partitions based on inout space:
    Partition #1: value < 0
    Partition #2: value = 0
    Partition #3: value > 0

    tests:
    1. Partition #2: x = 0,
        Expected: The set has the element 0 only
    2. Partition #3: x = 5, x = 5 (testing if adding duplicates is possible)
        Expected: The set has the element 5 only once
    3. Partition #1 and #3: x = 1, x = -1
        Expected: The set has (only) two correctly ordered elements: -1, 1
    4. Partition #1 and #2 and #3: x = 0, x = 0, x = -1000, x = 1000, x = 500
        Expected: The set has only one zero, and the value -1000 is at index 0 and the values 500 and 1000 are ordered
        after the value 0
    5. Not a bug, but a syntax complication; no need to write "else { if (condition)}" because java has
       an "else if {condition}" already

    Found bugs:
    1. A bug was found via the seconds test since the original method used to break from the for-loop when a duplicate
    is found. However, when exiting the loop, the program went to the last line of code that said to add the element to
    the set with no conditions.
    2. Another bug was caused by similar implementation when the integer we are trying to insert is less than the
    current element. That means that the integer should be inserted at a certain index (the current index) and shift
    all other elements to the right. The method does exactly that, but then breaks (similarly to bug 1) and executes
    the last line of code that adds the integer to the end of the set with no conditions. The method should instead
    return since the element is inserted, and we are done.

The method: member(int x):

* The specification_
    - requires: x is an integer
    - ensures: if x is in the set
               then
                    return true
               otherwise
                    return false

Input space:
    x in {MIN_INT, ..., 0, ..., MAX_INT}

    Partitions based on inout space:
    Partition #1: value < 0
    Partition #2: value = 0
    Partition #3: value > 0

    tests:
    1. Partition #1 and #3: x = -1000, x = -1, x = 4, x = 1000, x = 9999
        Expected: return false on all these x-values since the set does not include them.
        Note that the values x = -1000 and x = -1 and x = 4 are all expected to return false from the first return false
        clause, while x = 1000 and x = 9999 are expected to execute the second return false line
    2. Partition #2: x = 0 (testing to look up the first index in the set and a new partition)
        Expected: return true since the test set includes the integer 0
    3. Partition #3: x = 6 (testing the highest element in the set)
        Expected: return true since the test set includes the integer 6

    Found bugs:
    1. Not a bug, but a syntax complication; no need to write "else { if (condition)}" because java has
       an "else if {condition}" already

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The method DistinctClosed(IntBinaryOperator f):

* The specification:
    - requires: An IntBinaryOperator object (Means that the object has defined the applyAsInt method)
    - ensures:  if the result of "f.applyAsInt(x1, x2)"; where x1 and x2 are all possible pairs from the set; is in the set
                then
                    returns true
                otherwise
                    returns false

    IMPORTANT NOTE: We approached "if for any 2 distinct elements in the set" in a way that means that the pairs are
                    unordered which means that for example (2, 3) is equivalent to (3, 2) and the latter should
                    therefore not be checked
Input space:
    f is of the Type IntBinaryOperator

    No partitions taken for the input space!

    tests:
    1. testEmptySet: calling the method on an empty array
        Expected: return false
    2. testFalse:
        Expected: return false for both IntBinaryOperators
    3. testTrue:
        Expected: return true for both IntBinaryOperators (1000 + 6 = 1006) and (2 - 1000 = -998)

    Found bugs:
    1. Since the set does not allow for duplicates, it is unnecessary to check for the condition (vi == vj) if we define
       j as i+1: (int j = i + 1)
    2. The method negates the result of "member(f.applyAsInt(vi, vj))" which means that the result is handled falsely,
       this causes an error in the program and not a halt.
    2. The method's return values are oppositely placed, as to the expected behaviour, if the negation mentioned in
       bug 2 was to be corrected, the method would still be wrong since the method would return false when the result
       of "applyAsInt" is a member of the set.
